# Logistic-Regression# Coursera Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Machine Learning with Python offered by IBM. It focuses on predicting customer churn using Logistic Linear Regression. The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, their services, account details, and demographics. The primary objective is to predict whether a customer will leave within the last month (Churn = 1) or not (Churn = 0).

## Dataset

- The dataset is stored in the "Data" folder as `ChurnData.csv`.
- It includes the following columns:
  - Churn (target variable)
  - Services signed up for
  - Customer account information
  - Demographic information

## Code

- The modeling code can be found in the "Code" folder in the `logistic_regression.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Instructions (as provided by the Coursera Course)

1. **Training the Model**:
   - Open `logistic_regression.ipynb`.
   - Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train the Logistic Linear Regression model on the provided dataset.

2. **Evaluating the Model**:
   - Open `logistic_regression.ipynb`.
   - Execute the cells to calculate evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, Jaccard index, and log loss for your trained model.

## Model

- The trained Logistic Linear Regression model is saved in the "Models" folder as `logistic_regression.ipynb`.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Follow the instructions provided in the respective Jupyter Notebooks (`logistic_regression.ipynb`) as specified in the Coursera course.

3. Make sure to meet any additional requirements or instructions provided by the course instructors.
